# Monster in a Box

This is my take on a monster in a box. I had a brilliant idea and when I searched I saw so had 100's of others. This is my take on a monster in a box with a lot of thoughts and influence from a variety of projects.

To make halloween a little more fun I wanted to build something that would make people smile with fog, lights, lasers, sounds, and shaking. I wanted to this to be able to run autonomously or controlled via an app to let people control it remotely.

## Building the box

Item list
   - Fence boards (or any plank wood)
   - Screws
   - Wood glue
   - To age the wood
      - Black Tea
      - Vinegar
      - 0000 stell wool
      - Brush


My idea for a Monster in a Box started when I was thinking what I should do with some old fence boards that had been weathered in the backyard for 5 years. I wanted to use the wood for something and this box was it.

### Build the box
I sketched the box out a couple of different ways before cutting any wood to get it to the right size. I didn't have enough old wood to build the entire box so I wanted to space that wood out to hopefully give it an overall older look.

Putting the box together was harder than I expected from just a weight of the boards perspective. The boards were pretty heavy and I didn't want any shiny screws showing so I spent a lot of time 

### Age the wood
I had a mixture of really old wood, somewhat old wood, and brand new wood. 

As you build the box make sure to leave gaps, add holes, distress the wood some if it's too new so it looks beat up. It's important to do this before aging the wood.

Looking around I found a great tutorial I followed to age my wood so it looked similar

### Things I wish I had known
I made the mistake initially of building too good of a box without enough gaps, make sure you have gaps to see light and let the fog out more easily
