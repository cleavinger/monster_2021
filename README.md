# Monster in a box
This is my take on a monster in a box. I had a brilliant idea and when I searched I saw so had 100's of others. This is my take on a monster in a box with a lot of thoughts and influence from a variety of projects.

To make halloween a little more fun I wanted to build something that would make people smile with fog, lights, lasers, sounds, and shaking. I wanted to this to be able to run autonomously or controlled via an app to let people control it remotely.
